# CS307-Operating-System
> 2020.Spring SJTU CS307 projects and slides  
> Only part of the projects in the book are implemented here

## This course mainly introduces operating systems. Successful course participants will,  
* Understand basic machine organization, including processors, main memory, and input/output architecture.  
* Understand the basics of the memory hierarchy, including virtual memory and caches, and how these are implemented in hardware and software.  
* Understand the core concepts of operating systems, including processes, threads, synchronization, memory management, and file management strategies.  
* The idea of the course is to learn how computers really work, from the chip level up to the application level. You will understand what is actually happening when a computer system is running a set of programs, and will be able to make informed choices as a developer, project manager, or system customer.
